   <h2><strong>The importance of cooking at home</strong></h2>

   <p>Whether you <strong>live on your own or are a busy parent</strong>, 
       finding the time and energy to prepare home-cooked meals can seem 
       like a daunting task. At the end of a hectic day, 
       eating out or ordering in might feel like the quickest, 
       easiest option. But convenience and processed food 
       can take a significant toll on your mood and health.</p>

    <p><strong> Convenience food is typically high in chemical additives, hormones, sugar, salt, unhealthy fat, and calories,</strong> all of which can adversely affect your brain and outlook. It can leave you feeling tired, bloated, 
        and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety.</p>  
    <p><strong>Restaurants often serve more food than you should eat.</strong> Many restaurants serve portions that are two to three times larger than the recommended dietary guidelines. This encourages you to eat more than you would at home,
         adversely affecting your waistline, blood pressure, and risk of diabetes.</p>   
        <p><strong>When you prepare your own meals, you have more control over the ingredients.</strong> By cooking for yourself, you can ensure that you and your family eat fresh, wholesome meals. This can help you to look and feel healthier, boost your energy, stabilize your weight and mood, and improve your sleep and resilience to stress.</p>
